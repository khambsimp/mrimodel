# mrimodel
Convert MRI of upper Abdomen into a 3-D Model
This is where code that allows the different system components to talk to one another are located. Other code exists on my machine but some of it cannot be shared publically.

Funny enough this is still an open question. Within the current Computing context getting data from an image is still a really hard problem.
Within both contexts of linear algebraic manipulation to the discernment of a signal above the noise floor. Quantifying, and identifying objects within
water magnetic resonance means that there are particular sources of noise contribution and particular methods for construction of the right signal.
In particular, it is likely that to develop a high quality resonance signal, the mri signal would be designed to efficiently relay Electromagnetic Power at the frequency of desired resonance, while not distubing other physical parameters by the Sensors response to environmental stimuli.
